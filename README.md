## Introduction

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (or node) contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. This makes linked lists an efficient data structure for insertion and deletion operations.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Single Linked List in C, useful for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex data structures.

## Features

- Insert elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position in the list.
- Delete elements from the list.
- Display the elements in the list.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a C compiler like GCC.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderDebajyoti/Linked-List.git
```
```
cd Linked-List
```

## Usage

To compile and run the program:

```bash
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
```
```
./linked_list
```

You can then follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations on the linked list.

## Functions

- `insert`: Inserts a node into the linked list.
- `deleteNode`: Deletes a node from the linked list.
- `display`: Displays the current elements in the linked list.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
